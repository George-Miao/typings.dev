# typings.dev

Yet another typing tool for Shuang users, inspired by [Monkeytype.com](https://Monkeytype.com), [typings.gg](https://typings.gg) and [typing-cn](https://barneyzhao.gitee.io/typing-cn/), without the need of selecting words. You only need to enter the letters!

## Usage

- Go to [typings.dev](https://typings.dev)
- Select your preferred scheme at left-top corner
- Start tying! Remember: _don't type in Chinese. Only Pinyin is required._
